This important statement consists of 19 Arabic letters, and every word in it occurs in the whole Quran in multiples of 19 (see Appendices 1 & 29 for the details). \t \t \t*1:1-7 Sura 1 is God's gift to us to establish contact with Him through the daily Contact Prayers. This fact is supported by an earth-shattering, simple-to-understand-but-impossible-to-imitate mathematical composition that challenges the greatest mathematicians on earth, and stumps them; it is far beyond human capabilities:\n"
